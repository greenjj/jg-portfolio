# ðŸ“Œ Curriculum Learning for Robust Agile Drone Flight - IN PROGRESS

## ðŸ“– Overview
Reinforcement learning-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable success in enabling fast and agile flight. Currently, the training process of these reinforcement learning controllers relies on a static, pre-defined curriculum. In this project, we work to develop a dynamic and adaptable curriculum to enhance the robustness of the learning-based controllers. This curriculum continually adapts in an online fashion based on the controller's performance during the training process. By using the adaptive curriculum, we expect the reinforcement learning controllers to enable more diverse, generalizable, and robust performance in unforeseen scenarios for drone flight.
